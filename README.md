This is an analysis of women's education rates in Pinellas, Pasco, and Hillsborough Counties. 
These are all neighbouring counties in Florida, with their notable cities being St. Petersburg, 
New Port Richey, and Tampa, respectively. This will begin with analysis of the rates and age ranges of
women's education rates within the state. Then I will move into training a model to predict, given a woman in a specific county and age range, the likihood that they would
obtain a certain degree.

This project is being used to understand and learn Machine Learning.
